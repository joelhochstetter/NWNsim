Simulation and network generation code is written by past and present members of the Kuncic group at the University of Sydney: Joel Hochstetter, Ruomin Zhu, Alon Loeffler, Zdenka Kuncic, Paula Sanz-Leon, Ido Marcus and Miro Astore. Authors of each function are attributed within.

Please direct questions to Joel Hochstetter (joel.hochstetter@sydney.edu.au).

## Requirements
For simulations MATLAB is required. Code has been tested on MATLAB2016b and MATLAB2020b.

The following MATLAB toolboxes are required:
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

For network generation: Python 2.7 or above is required. Two pre-generated networks are provided.

## Getting started
Add all files and sub-folders in "simulator" to the MATLAB path. Follow instructions in "figures" folder to run the necessary simulations and analysis for each figure from the manuscript.
