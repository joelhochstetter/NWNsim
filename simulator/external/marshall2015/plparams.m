%% PLPARAMS - automated computation of power law parameters using MLE
% Higher level macro and automated algorithm that computes the exponent for
% power-law distributed data and its uncertainty, the p-value and ks
% statistic for the fit, and searches for optimal support [xmin,xmax]. The
% function utilizes a "smart" greedy search algorithm to settle on a
% support pair. Prior to initiating the greedy search, all support pairs
% for which xmin and xmax differ by 1 are removed; the remainder are then
% sorted by log(xmax/xmin).
%
% Syntax: [tau, xmin, xmax, sigmaTau, p, pCrit, ks] = plparams(x, varargin)
%
% Input:
%   x (vector double) - random data that we would like to fit to the power
%     law distribution p(x) ~ x^(-tau) for x >= xmin and x <= xmax.
%
% Variable Inputs:
%   (..., 'samples', nSamples) - the number of sample distributions to draw.
%     Sets the resolution of the p-value (scalar double) (default: 500)
%   (..., 'threshold', pCrit) - for computational efficiency, a critical
%     p-value can be used to halt the computation if the likelihood of a
%     successful trial (given by the binomial distribution, see likelihood
%     below) drops below a pre-determined likelihood value. If pCrit is set
%     to 1, the computation will execute in full. Note: this only affects 
%     the greedy search process; final p-value is computed in full (scalar 
%     double) (default: .2)
%   (..., 'likelihood', likelihood) - likelihood threshold for binomial
%     process (scalar double) (default: 10^(-3))
%
% Outputs:
%   tau (scalar double) - slope of power law region
%   xmin (scalar double) - lower truncation of distribution
%   xmax (scalar double) - upper truncation of distribution
%   sigmaTau (scalar double) - error of the tau original fit estimated 
%     using the samples drawn from the model fit. If p is small, this error
%     is not valid.
%   p (scalar double) - proportion of sample distributions with KS
%     statistics larger than the KS statistic between the empirical pdf and
%     the model distribution. p is bounded by 0 and 1. A p-value of 1 
%     indicates that the KS statistic between the empirical pdf and the 
%     model was smaller than the KS statistic between the sample 
%     distributions and the model. Conversely, a p-value of 0 indicates 
%     that KS(simulated) > KS(empirical) for every sample.
%   pCrit (scalar double) - critical p-value used to truncate computation
%   ks (scalar double) - Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic between the 
%     empirical pdf and the model
%
% Example:
%   x = bentpl(10000);
%     % generates random data distributed between two disjoint power law
%       regions with slopes 1.5 and 2.5 and first upper truncation of 50
%   [tau, xmin, xmax, sigma, p, pCrit, ks] = plparams(x);
%     % compute all power law parameters
%   [tau,~,~,~,p] = plparams(x, 'threshold', 1);
%     % compute power law exponent and full p-value
%   [~,~,~,~,p] = plparams(x, 'threshold', 1, 'samples', 1000);
%     % compute full p-value using 1000 simulated sets (increases
%       resolution of p-value)
