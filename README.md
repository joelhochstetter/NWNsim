## Requirements
For simulations MATLAB is required. Code has been tested on MATLAB2016b and MATLAB2020b.

The following MATLAB toolboxes are required:
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox

For network generation: Python 2.7 or above is required. Two pre-generated networks are provided.

## Getting started
Add all files and sub-folders in "simulator" to the MATLAB path. Follow instructions in "figures" folder to run the necessary simulations and analysis for each figure from the manuscript.
